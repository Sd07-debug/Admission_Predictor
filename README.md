# Graduate Admission Prediction
[![built with Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with%20-Streamlit-brightgreen)](https://www.streamlit.io/)


Graduate Admission Prediction (GAP) is an analysis project based on my paper "A Comparative Study of Regression Algorithms for Predicting Graduate Admission to a University" (read my [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343280957_A_Comparative_Study_of_Regression_Algorithms_for_Predicting_Graduate_Admission_to_a_University)). The web app is built with Python and Streamlit.



The dataset , we used in this project is take from "Mohan S Acharya, Asfia Armaan, Aneeta S Antony : A Comparison of Regression Models for Prediction of Graduate Admissions, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019" Paper. This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset.


To run this app locally:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run gap.py
```
